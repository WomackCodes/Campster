### _Getting started:_

This app is still a work in progress and is currently being overhaualed to remove class based components and replace them with hooks and functional components.

Once all icebox items have been implemented there will be a redesign of the websites look to be more dynamiv, consume 3rd party API's to get real time weather and sky reports, and allow for communications between linked users to a trip for text messaging via Twilio. 

Current state is a full suite of user-CRUD to simply make trips in a MERN-stack browser app with authentation/authorization features for logged in users.
